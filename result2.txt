Experiment 2: SDN (L2) - Results
================================================================

This file will be populated when you run: sudo python3 exp2.py

The script will automatically:
1. Create the network topology with hosts h1, h2, h3 and switches s1, s2
2. Run initial ping tests (before flow rules)
3. Show switch s1 port state and flow table using ovs-ofctl
4. Configure flow rules:
   - Drop all flows from port s1-eth2
   - Forward all flows from port s1-eth1 to s1-eth3
5. Run final ping tests (after flow rules)

Expected content:
- Initial ping tests: from h1 to h3, from h2 to h3
- ovs-ofctl show s1 output
- ovs-ofctl dump-flows s1 output (before and after flow rules)
- Flow rule commands used
- Final ping test: from h1 to h3
